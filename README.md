# Music Releases&ensp;|&ensp;[View Live &#10555;](https://music-releases-react-app.netlify.app/)

A pair programming assignment and an introduction to React. Styled using Spotify as a guide. 

The goal was to learn the foundations of React and core concepts like components and props, while also how to solve problems together and collaborate as a team. Made using Live Share in VS Code – taking turns – where one person "drives" and writes code while the other "navigate" and reviews and plan ahead.
